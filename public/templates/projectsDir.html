					I participated in Tackle Impossible Hackathon sponsored by Budweiser. To represent
our product I created this landing page to collect customersâ€™ data and manage it.
This website is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Jade. It has a customer
sign up form, contact us form, and an admin panel on the background.
